# Office Space Rental App (React Lab)

## About This Project

This is a simple React application created for my web development lab. The main goal of this project was to practice using JSX to build a user interface. The app displays a list of office spaces for rent, showing details like the name, address, and monthly rent.

## What I Learned

This was a great hands-on lab! I got to practice some important React concepts:

* **JSX Syntax:** I learned how to write HTML-like code directly in my JavaScript files. It felt a bit weird at first but makes building components much easier.

* **Creating Components:** The entire application is built inside the main `App` component.

* **Using JavaScript Expressions:** I used curly braces `{}` to embed JavaScript variables and expressions, like displaying the office names and rents.

* **Mapping Arrays to Elements:** Instead of writing the HTML for each office manually, I stored the data in an array of objects and used the `.map()` function to loop through it and render each listing. This was really cool and powerful!

* **Conditional Inline Styling:** I used a ternary operator inside a `style` attribute to change the color of the rent price. If the rent is below Rs. 60000, it shows up in red, and if it's higher, it shows up in green.
