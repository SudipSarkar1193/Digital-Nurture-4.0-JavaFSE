## Description

This repository contains week-wise materials, assignments, and exercises for the **Digital Nurture 4.0 – Java Full Stack Engineer (JavaFSE)** training program conducted by **Cognizant**.

- **Week1_DesignPatterns/**: Focused on foundational design pattern concepts.
  - **Exercise 1/**:
    - `src/`: Java source code files for the first exercise.
    - `bin/`: Compiled class files.
    - `output/`: Sample outputs and test results.
  - **Exercise 2/**: Follows a similar structure for a different design pattern implementation or this -
    - `output_Screenshot/`: Sample output Screenshots.
    - { `...IntelliJ Folder structure for spring project` }
- **Week1_Data Structure & Algorithms/**: Contains basic problems and solutions related to common data structures and algorithmic logic using Java.

- **Week2\_[subject]/**: Placeholder for content covered in the second week (e.g., PLSQL, Unit Testing , etc.).
- **Week3\_[subject]/**: Placeholder for the third week's topics (e.g., Spring Core, REST APIs, etc.).

- **...**: The structure continues in a modular format for each week, categorizing content by topics and practical exercises.

`This structure provides a clear organization for the Java Full Stack Engineer (JavaFSE) course materials, ensuring easy navigation and access to resources.`

---

Each week's folder contains Assignments & `Each Assignment contains` :

- 🧠 Source code (`/src`)
- ✅ Compiled binaries (`/bin`) {May or may not be}
- 📸 Output screenshots (`/output`)
- 📄 `README.md`
- 📦 pom.xml {May or may not be}

## 🚀 Additional Project: Full-Stack Social Media Application (Spring Boot + React)

As part of my personal learning and to strengthen my backend development skills using **Spring Boot**, I’m also working on a **full-stack social media web application** beyond the scope of the DN 4.0 training.

### 🛠️ Project Overview

- **Frontend:** Built with **React.js**. Originally, this frontend was connected to a backend developed in **JavaScript**.

- **Backend:** - I am now rebuilding the backend using **Spring Boot**, adding **extra features** beyond the scope of the training. This includes applying concepts from the Digital Nurture program such as:

  - RESTful API development
  - JPA and database integration
  - Layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)
  - Using Modern tools like 'Lombok'
  - Dependency injection and best practices in Spring Boot

This integration allows me to apply my Spring Boot knowledge in a real-world context, while modifying the existing React frontend for better compatibility.

### 🔗 GitHub Repositories

- 🔧 **Backend Repository (Spring Boot):** [Backend Repo Link](https://github.com/SudipSarkar1193/Springboot-Social-Media)

> 🔍 These repositories reflect my proactive approach to mastering full-stack development and going beyond the training requirements with a real-world application.
