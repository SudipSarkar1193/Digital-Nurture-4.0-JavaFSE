## Big O Notation and Algorithm Analysis

Big O notation is a mathematical representation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or space complexity as a function of input size (`n`). It provides a standardized way to analyze and compare algorithm efficiency, focusing on the `worst-case` scenario while also considering best and average cases.

- **Purpose**: Helps evaluate how an algorithm scales with larger inputs, enabling developers to choose optimal solutions for performance-critical applications like e-commerce search.
- **Key Insight**: Ignores constants and lower-order terms (e.g., O(2n) simplifies to O(n)), focusing on dominant growth rates.

## Assignment Summary

This project implements a simple e-commerce product search functionality using core Java, following proper software design principles.

The user searches for products based on **product name**. The search system implements:

- **Manual Merge Sort (O(n log n))** to sort product list based on `product name`.
- **Linear Search (O(n))** and **Binary Search (O(log n))** algorithms for searching.
- **Time measurement** for both search algorithms to demonstrate their efficiency.

**Note** - We are using a CSV file containing 150 product records. The product data is loaded into memory using the following method call:

```java
  productService.loadProductsFromCSV("src/products.csv");

```


## ðŸ”§ Key Features

âœ… Load product data from a CSV file (`products.csv`)  
âœ… Sort products by **product name** using **custom Merge Sort**  
âœ… Perform both **Linear Search** and **Binary Search**  
âœ… Measure and display **execution time** for both search approaches  
âœ… Fully modular package structure following real-world software architectu


## Search Operation Scenarios

The project implements two search algorithms: Linear Search and Binary Search. Below are their time complexities for different scenarios when searching by `productName` in an array of products.

### Linear Search
- **Description**: Sequentially checks each element until a match is found or the array is exhausted.
- **Time Complexities**:
  - **Best Case**: O(1) â€“ Target is the first element.
  - **Average Case**: O(n) â€“ Target is typically in the middle, requiring half the array to be scanned on average.
  - **Worst Case**: O(n) â€“ Target is the last element or not present, requiring a full scan.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) â€“ Uses only a constant amount of extra space.

### Binary Search
- **Description**: Requires a sorted array and repeatedly divides the search interval in half, comparing the middle element to the target.
- **Time Complexities**:
  - **Best Case**: O(1) â€“ Target is the middle element on the first comparison.
  - **Average Case**: O(log n) â€“ Requires logarithmic steps to narrow down to the target.
  - **Worst Case**: O(log n) â€“ Target is at the edge of the array or not present, still requiring logarithmic steps.
- **Prerequisite**: Array must be sorted, which incurs a one-time O(n log n) cost using Merge Sort.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for iterative implementation (used here).

## Algorithm Comparison

- **Linear Search**:
  - **Time Complexity**: O(n) for average and worst cases.
  - **Advantages**: Simple, works on unsorted data, no preprocessing required.
  - **Disadvantages**: Inefficient for large datasets, as performance degrades linearly with array size.
- **Binary Search**:
  - **Time Complexity**: O(log n) for average and worst cases, but requires O(n log n) for sorting upfront.
  - **Advantages**: Highly efficient for large datasets, logarithmic scaling ensures fast searches.
  - **Disadvantages**: Requires sorted data, incurring a sorting cost if the array isnâ€™t pre-sorted.
- **Key Trade-off**: Linear Search is better for small or unsorted datasets with infrequent searches, while Binary Search excels for large, sorted datasets with frequent searches.

## Suitability for E-commerce Platform

For an e-commerce platform with a large product catalog (e.g., thousands of products) and frequent user searches, **Binary Search** is the more suitable algorithm:

- **Performance**: O(log n) search time significantly outperforms O(n), especially for large `n`. For example, searching 10,000 products takes ~14 comparisons with Binary Search vs. ~10,000 with Linear Search (worst case).
- **Sorting Cost**: The O(n log n) cost of Merge Sort is incurred once (or when products are added), but this is amortized over multiple searches, making it negligible for frequent queries.
- **Real-world Context**: E-commerce platforms prioritize fast search response times to enhance user experience. Binary Searchâ€™s logarithmic complexity aligns with this need, assuming products can be maintained in sorted order by `productName`.
- **Scalability**: As the product catalog grows, Binary Searchâ€™s performance advantage becomes more pronounced, ensuring scalability.

In conclusion, while Linear Search is simpler and viable for small catalogs, Binary Search is the optimal choice for an e-commerce platform due to its efficiency and suitability for large-scale, frequent search operations.
